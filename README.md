# Basic-Chatbot-with-Integrating-Tools
This project is a LangGraph-based chatbot that uses LLMs like Groq LLaMA or OpenAI to handle intelligent, context-aware conversations. It integrates tools for tasks such as calculations, translations, and web searches, and its modular design makes it easy to extend with new features or tools.
